											<p>The majority of the world’s rivers is fragmented and fish passes are frequently installed to enable fish
												passage across river obstacles. Beside native, also invasive species, such as round goby, can use fish passes
												to disperse upstream in uninvaded ecosystems. The present study aimed at evaluating a prototype hydraulic
												barrier in a vertical slot fish pass that impedes passage of the invasive round goby and enables passage of
												native, comparable species, such as gudgeon and bullhead. In addition, the study was designed to provide
												basic insight in the differences between the hydraulic forces experienced by the fish species in the flow and
												their individual behavioural response to different flow conditions.</p>
											<p>The barrier was designed to homogenize the flow field over an extended distance to exceed the swimming
												capability of the round goby and impede resting by station holding due to the smooth bottom. The selective
												effect was created by the flow field that induced hydraulic burden, varying between species due to the
												individual body shapes of the fish.</p>
											<p>The performance of the hydraulic barrier was assessed using a three step-approach: Flow measurements
												(Step 1), measurements of the hydraulic forces experienced by preserved fish (Step 2) and live fish
												swimming behaviour observations in the same flow field (Step 3). This approach was applied in a flow
												channel study under homogenised flow conditions and in a nearly full-scale vertical slot fish pass model.
												The purpose of this approach was to evaluate the prototype hydraulic barrier (i), create basic evidence about
												how flow affects the fish species individually and whether the hydraulic burden experienced in the flow
												field differ between species (ii), and to assess how the hydraulic burden experienced by benthic fish affect
												the passage behaviour across the prototype hydraulic barrier and at an unaffected vertical slot (iii).</p>
											<p>The results showed: There was a species selective effect of the prototype hydraulic barrier. No round goby
												passed the barrier at the highest water discharge tested (130 L/s), while six gudgeon passed the barrier and
												four bullhead attempted passage but immediately returned. This passage behaviour agreed with the
												hydraulic forces measured as gudgeon experienced significantly lower forces at 130 L/s water discharge
												compared to the other species. Because the hydraulic forces differed between species and corresponded to
												the live fish swimming behaviour, and the live fish passage behaviour differed between water discharges,
												it is probable that the selective effect of the barrier was mediated by the created flow field. Beside this
												selective effect, the prototype barrier had a general impact on the fish migration behaviour. There were
												significantly less passages recorded at the prototype hydraulic barrier compared to the downstream
												untreated slot.</p>
											<p>The fish indeed experience hydraulic burden differing between species and these hydraulic burden
												correspond to the individual swimming styles of the corresponding species. The fish respond to these
												hydraulic burden individually, depending on their own species biology. Nevertheless, there was a general
												adaptation of the passage behaviour to increased water discharge: All species swam faster with more speed
												variation and with straighter paths upstream the barrier.</p>
											<p>With providing basic evidence about the individual hydraulic burden an invasive species experiences in
												comparison to two native, comparable species, this thesis is a further step towards species selective
												fragmentation of rivers for ecosystem conservation purposes. These findings open an avenue to fish pass
												design adapted to the fish community of specific ecosystems and will inform fish pass engineers, decision
												makers and researchers who work about the behavioural response of fish to flowing water.</p>

										<div class="content">
											<p>Die Mehrzahl der Flüsse auf der Erde sind fragmentiert. Um Fischen die Wanderung stromauf zu
												ermöglichen, werden häufig Fischpässe an Wanderhindernissen eingesetzt. Neben einheimischen Arten
												wandern ebenfalls invasive Arten, wie etwa die Schwarzmundgrundel, diese Fischpässe hinauf und
												bedrohen stromauf gelegene Ökosysteme. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschreibt einen Protoypen einer
												hydraulischen, selektiven Sperre für den Einsatz in ‘Vertical slot’ Fischpässen. Diese Sperre soll den
												Aufstieg der invasiven Schwarzmundgrundel verhindern und gleichzeitig für einheimische und
												vergleichbare Arten, wie etwa Gründling oder Groppe, durchlässig sein. Zusätzlich soll die Studie
												Grundlagenwissen über die individuellen hydraulischen Hürden und die Art und Weise, wie die Fische mit
												Ihrem Schwimmverhalten auf die Hürden umgehen, schaffen.</p>	
											<p>Das Funktionsprinzip der Sperre ist, dass die Strömung über eine gewisse Distanz homogenisiert wird und
												die bodenlebenden Fische durch die glatte Oberfläche daran gehindert werden, sich am Boden festzusetzen
												und auszuruhen. Der selektive Effekt soll durch ein Strömungsfeld erzeugt werden, das aufgrund
												unterschiedlicher Körperform der Fische unterschiedliche hydraulische Kräfte auf die Fischkörper erzeugt.
												Damit erzeugt das Strömungsfeld aufgrund der individuellen Körperform der Fischarten unterschiedliche
												hydraulische Hürden für die Fische bei der Überwindung der Sperre.</p>	
											<p>Die Sperre wurde in einem dreistufigen Verfahren getestet: Strömungsmessungen (Stufe 1), Messungen der
												hydraulischen Kräfte, die die Fische in der Strömung erfahren (Stufe 2) und Beobachtungen des
												Schwimmverhaltens lebender Fische im selben Strömungsfeld (Stufe 3). Dieses Verfahren wurde in
												Vorversuchen in einem Schwimmkanal unter standardisierten Strömungsverhältnissen und in einem
												physischen, fast maẞstabsgetreuen ‘Vertical slot’ Fischpass angewendet. Dabei sollte die Funktionalität
												der hydraulischen Sperre untersucht werden (i), Grundlagenwissen darüber geschaffen werden, wie
												Strömung die Fischarten unterschiedlich beeinflusst und ob die Fischarten unterschiedliche hydraulische
												Hürden bei der Passage der Sperre überwinden müssen (ii) und untersucht werden, wie diese hydraulischen
												Hürden das Schwimmverhalten der Fische unterschiedliche beeinflussen.</p>
											<p>Die Ergebnisse zeigen: Die hydraulische Sperre hat eine artselektive Wirkung. Beim höchsten getesteten
												Wasserabfluss (130 L/s) passierten keine Schwarzmundgrundeln die Barriere, während sechs Gründlinge
												die Barriere passierten und vier Groppen eine Passage versuchten, jedoch sofort zurückkehrten. Dieses
												Durchgangsverhalten stimmt mit den gemessenen hydraulischen Kräften insofern überein, dass Gründlinge
												im Vergleich zu den anderen Arten signifikant geringere Kräfte bei 130 L/s Wasserabfluss erfahren. Da die
												hydraulischen Kräfte zwischen den Arten unterschiedlich sind, dem Schwimmverhalten der lebenden
												Fische entsprechen und das Verhalten der lebenden Fische zwischen den Wassereinleitungen
												unterschiedlich ist, ist eine selektive Wirkung der Barriere durch das erzeugte Strömungsfeld sehr
												wahrscheinlich.</p>
											<p>Neben diesem selektiven Effekt hatte die Barriere einen generellen Einfluss auf das
												Fischaufstiegsverhalten. An der hydraulischen Sperre wurden im Vergleich zum stromabwärts gelegenen,
												unbehandelten Schlitz, deutlich weniger Passagen der Fische aufgezeichnet.
												Tatsächlich erfahren die Fische je nach Art unterschiedliche hydraulische Belastungen in der Strömung.
												Auf diese hydraulische Belastung reagieren die Fische individuell, entsprechend ihrer eigenen Artbiologie.
												Es wurde allerdings auch eine generelle Anpassung des Schwimmverhaltens an stärkere Strömung bei allen
												Arten beobachtet: Alle Arten schwammen schneller mit mehr Geschwindigkeitsvariation und mit geraderen
												Wegen die hydraulische Sperre hinauf.</p>
											<p>Diese grundlagenwissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse über die hydraulischen Hürden in Fischpässen einer
												invasiven Art im Vergleich zu zwei einheimischen, vergleichbaren Arten, sind ein wichtiger Schritt
												Richtung artselektive Fragmentierung von Flüssen zum Schutz des Ökosystems.
												Diese Thesis bietet Grundlagen für die Gestaltung von Fischaufstiegshilfen, die an die Anforderungen des
												Ökosystems angepasst sind. Damit hat sie Relevanz für Fischpass-Entwickler, Entscheidungsträger und
												Wissenschaftler, die über das Verhalten von Fischen in der Strömung forschen.</p>

										<div class="content">
											<p>At the beginning was a fish in my hand. It was a cloudy day at the time when I went to school. I was a
												passionate angler and loved to fish some great barbels and eels in the lower Rhine near Cologne. I spent
												numerous hours there, rather than learning for my school exams and it was just a great time. Then came the
												day when I held this fish in my hand. I caught it in the Rhine some seconds ago and I just wondered. It was
												a small fish, about 10 cm long, which looked a bit curious. It was hard to identify the species but with my
												unexperienced view, I identified this fish as a European bullhead. Knowing that bullhead prefer rivers with
												good water quality, I was very happy, solved the fish from the hook carefully and released it into the river.
												Indeed, happiness did not stay long. It were only seconds and the small bell on the top of my rod rang again
												and I caught the next ‘bullhead’. This continued until the evening and I packed my stuff and went home.
												The fishing day was very disappointing because I caught numerous small ‘bullheads’ but not a single big
												and strong barbel. At this time, I did not guess that this day would have important impact on my future.</p>	
											<p>The time of good fishing at the river Rhine was over and I never caught a great barbel again. I still spent
												years fishing for barbels at the Rhine, but the only fish I caught was this small fish that looked like a
												bullhead. However, I knew from fishing magazines that it was an invasive species, called round goby. There
												was hope it might disappear someday, but the round goby stayed.</p>
											<p>I finished school, studied Biology in Düsseldorf, and decided to continue my studies in a Masters Program
												at the University of Rostock. Looking forward to many fishing opportunities in Rostock, I thought to leave
												the round goby behind –not knowing that round gobies had distributed in the Western Baltic Sea already
												and became even bigger in brackish environments. I just felt a bit tracked by the round goby but accepted
												the opportunity to investigate predation of the round goby on Atlantic herring eggs in my Master thesis,
												which I performed at the Thünen-Institute for Baltic Sea fisheries. Fortunately, this thesis opened the door
												to Basel for investigating methods to impede the upstream migration of the round goby via active
												swimming.</p>
											<p>This story reports my inner motivation for the following thesis. This story and my personal experience
												taught me one thing: Every catastrophe provides a chance. It is up to us what we make out of it.</p>
											<p>During the work at my dissertation, I experienced two more catastrophes with such a force, that years were
												required to recognize the chance provided. Shortly after the beginning of my research project, my wife and
												I said goodbye to our first born son, who died late in pregnancy before giving birth for unknown reasons.
												About two years later, my younger brother passed away by suicide. After these events, my research project
												became least important of everything and it took a lot of mental strength to just keep going. However, much
												power was provided by my wonderful wife and my fantastic kids. Both living kids were born during my
												dissertation project. Now, when I am sitting here at my desk and write down my thesis, I can hear them
												playing in the living room and the chance from the experienced becomes clear to me: It is our responsibility
												to take care of the younger members of our community and we must provide them with all the tools and
												advice available to develop themselves, the society, the globe, and science.</p>

									<h3>River fragmentation and fish passage</h3>

									<article>
										<div class="content">
											<p>Rivers have undergone significant changes in the two past centuries <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0928-2025(07)11161-5">(Habersack & Piégay, 2007)</a>. Today,
												the majority of the world’s rivers are fragmented by anthropogenic barriers <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-3005-2">(Belletti et al., 2020)</a>. Indeed,
												river connectivity has been reported to be important for fish diversity <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.06.340" >(Shao et al., 2019)</a>, which is why
												diverse passage constructions have been developed <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.07.004">(Katopodis & Williams, 2012)</a>. Numerous fish pass
												types were developed following a trial-and-error approach, focusing predominantly on the passage of
												economically relevant species, such as salmonids <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.07.004">(Katopodis & Williams, 2012</a>; <a href="">Roscoe & Hinch, 2010)</a>.
												Following the application of fish passes that were actually designed for salmonid species for the whole fish
												community, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2007.00557.x">Mallen-Cooper & Brand (2007)</a> observed a poor performance of these fish passes for native
												species and even an increase of non-native species. The Convention on Biological Diversity raised the need
												to adapt fish passes to the requirements of species of relevance for the ecosystems <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/legal/cbd-en.pdf">(United Nations, 1992)</a>.
												To develop fish pass structures accounting for the individual differences in swimming performance between
												species, a combination of research approaches from fluid dynamics, engineering and behavioural ecology
												is promising <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Theodore-Castro-Santos/publication/265050016_Fishway_evaluations_for_better_bioengineering_--_an_integrative_approach/links/55e5a3e808aede0b5736605a/Fishway-evaluations-for-better-bioengineering--an-integrative-approach.pdf">(Castro-Santos et al., 2012)</a>.</p>
											<p>A modern, frequently investigated fish pass type is the vertical slot fish pass, which is commonly installed
												at transversal structures, such as weirs <a href="https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)0733-
												9429(1999)125:4(351)">(Wu et al., 1999)</a>. Vertical slot fish passes consist of a rectangular
												channel with partition walls. These partition walls contain vertical openings which separate the channel
												into pools. The flow through these slots creates a jet with accelerated flow velocities that has to be passed
												by the fish migrating upstream <a href="https://doi.org/10.1061/(asce)0733-
												9429(1999)125:4(351)">(Wu et al., 1999)</a>. Due to its construction, vertical slot fish passes are robust
												against variation in water discharge and maintain steady hydraulic conditions at slots and pools <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.07.004">(Katopodis
												& Williams, 2012)</a>.</p>
											<h3>The threat of invasive species</h3>
											<p>Invasive species have become a world-wide threat to aquatic ecosystems <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-2166-0">(Havel et al., 2015)</a>. Designing
												fish passes that support specific species of importance for the ecosystem and hold back undesired species
												can support species selective fragmentation of the river <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1795">(Rahel & McLaughlin, 2018)</a>. Selective
												fragmentation is a possible management option to impede the spreading of invasive species <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1795">(Rahel &
												McLaughlin, 2018)</a>. Ensuring the passage of native species and impeding the passage of invasive species
												over river obstacles is a major challenge for decision makers and requires advances in integrated
												interdisciplinary research <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1795">(Rahel and McLaughlin, 2018)</a>.</p>
											<p>One of the 100 worst aquatic invasive species has been reported the round goby <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-015-0718-9">(Hirsch et al., 2016)</a>. The
												round goby arrived in Switzerland 2012 <a href="https://doi.org/10.3391/bir.2013.2.1.14">(Kalchhauser et al., 2013)</a> and continued to disperse upstream the
												River Rhine <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3409">(Lutz et al., 2020)</a>. Beside diffusion across short distance, also long distance dispersal via
												active swimming (approximately 500 m per year) have been reported for round goby <a href="">(Bronnenhuber et al.,
												2011)</a>. Because of the individual swimming style of the round goby <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9867-2">(Tierney et al., 2011)</a>, the idea of
												selective hydraulic barrier seems feasible <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11681/5086">(Hoover et al., 2003)</a>, which is why the round goby swimming
												performance has been assessed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9867-2">Tierney et al. (2011)</a> and <a href="">Hoover et al. (2003)</a>. Indeed, to create a
												hydraulic selective barrier for the round goby that is passable by native species, it must be understood how
												the round goby swimming response to the flow conditions in the barrier differ between comparable, native
												species.</p>
											<h3>Swimming in fish</h3>
											<p>Fish are generally well adapted to move in their fluid environment <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00348-007-0357-4">(Lauder and Madden 2007)</a>. The main
												properties of water, especially its high density and incompressibility, have played an important role in fish
												evolution <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/48.757275">(Sfakiotakis et al., 1999)</a>. There are numerous ways fish create vortices in the water body to move
												in flowing water <a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.fluid.38.050304.092201">(Fish & Lauder, 2006</a>; <a href="">Lauder, 2015</a>; <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.fluid.32.1.33">Triantafyllou et al., 2000)</a>, which have evolved with
												time <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/48.757275">(Sfakiotakis et al., 1999)</a>. One specialized swimming style has been reported for benthic fish, such as
												the round goby: the ability to hold station at the bottom to save energy in flowing water <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-016-0514-9">(Gilbert et al., 2016</a>;
												<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9867-2">Tierney et al., 2011)</a>. Small body size (7-8 cm length, 1-2 cm height) facilitates station holding by escaping
												the flow at cobble substrates. In addition, larger pectoral fins enabled a benthic fish, darter
												(Etheostoma tetrazonum Hubbs & Black, 1940), to produce negative lift forces pressing the fish to the
												bottom <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.051938">(Carlson & Lauder, 2011)</a>.</p>
											<h3>Model species</h3>
											<p>Such behaviour, to produce downwards directed forces using pectoral fins for station holding and thereby
												increasing the swimming capacity, has also been reported for the invasive round goby (Neogobius
												melanostomus Pallas, 1814) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-016-0514-9">(Gilbert et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9867-2">Tierney et al., 2011)</a>. In addition, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9867-2">Tierney et al., (2011)</a>
												reported a general tendency to swim upstream of the round goby at moderate velocities, while it has been
												reported that the water discharge must be greater than 125 cm/s to prevent round goby upstream migration.
												A similar bottom-dwelling fish species is European bullhead (Cottus gobio L.), which occupies a similar
												ecological niche as the round goby <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10090821">(Roje et al., 2021)</a>. Bullhead prefer creeks with higher velocities and
												coarse substrate <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-1112.2005.00736.x">(Davey et al., 2005</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-1112.2005.00782.x">Van Liefferinge et al., 2005)</a>, while low swimming capacities have
												been reported <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00280.x">(Tudorache et al., 2008)</a>. Indeed, bullheads profit from a similar station holding behaviour
												based on usage of pectoral fins to ‘anchor’ on the bottom <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00280.x">(Tudorache et al., 2008)</a>.</p>
											<p>Gudgeon (Gobio gobio L.) is another bottom-dwelling fish occurring in similar habitats like round goby
												and bullhead. Contrary to the round goby and bullhead, gudgeon has more a bentho-pelagic life style and
												no specialized station holding behaviour has been reported for gudgeon.</p>
											<p>Because bullhead and gudgeon are native species of the local fish community in the River Rhine and its
												tributaries near Basel and the mentioned similarities in their species biology and swimming behaviour, they
												were selected as representatives for native fish in the present study.</p>
											<h3>How do fish experience the flow?</h3>
											<p>To create a hydraulic barrier with a flow field that affects the passage behaviour of fish species differently,
												it is important to understand how the fish experience the flow differently. Several studies aimed at
												perceiving the flow field from a fish perspective –for example via artificial lateral line systems <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2014.0467">(Chambers
												et al., 2014</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.10.008">Fuentes-Pérez et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-3182/7/3/036004">Venturelli et al., 2012)</a>. There are robots mimicking
												swimming fish to understand basics in fish kinematics <a href="">(Thandiackal et al., 2021)</a>. Indeed, these studies are
												commonly based on simplified fish shapes and neglect the effect of the individual body shape of the fish
												on their hydraulic burden experienced. Fish morphology is directly related to swimming costs <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00360-005-0024-0">(Ohlberger,
												Staaks, & Hölker, 2006)</a> and several studies showed morphological adaptation in fish from riverine habitats
												<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00435-020-00480-7">(Dashinov et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.842">Franssen et al., 2013</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/jfbi.2002.2131">Imre, 2002</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1926-1">Meyers & Belk, 2014)</a>. It is possible that these
												adaptations in body shape in habitats of increased flow occurred to reduce the hydraulic forces experienced.</p>
											<p>Mathematical models are commonly used to estimate the hydraulic forces fish bodies experience in flowing
												water, such as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.202.18.2393">Drucker & Lauder (1999)</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00348-
												013-1655-7">Sällström & Ukeiley (2014)</a>, <a href="">Van Wassenbergh et al. (2015)</a>.
												Indeed, more direct measurements at real fish would probably provide a more realistic picture of the
												hydraulic burden. Therefore, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/jfbi.2000.1288">Sagnes et al., (2000)</a> implemented measurements of drag experienced by dead
												fish, when describing the change in hydraulic drag during ontogenesis of grayling larvae (Thymallus
												thymallus L.). Further studies applying physical force measurements focus on single species and artificial
												fish <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112099005455">(Barrett et al., 1999</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2018.0714">Quicazan-Rubio et al., 2019)</a>.</p>
											<p>Measuring the direct forces experienced and comparing these forces between species might increase the
												understanding of how flow affects the fish species differently. This can be the key for understanding how
												flow fields can be changed to induce selective passage of specific fish species corresponding to the
												ecosystem requirements.</p>
											<h3>Objectives and hypotheses</h3>
											<p>One purpose of this study was to provide the fundamentals for a hydraulic barrier that impedes the further
												upstream migration of the round goby, while maintaining passage of comparable native species, such as
												bullhead or gudgeon. The prototype barrier was designed and tested based on the idea of a selective,
												hydraulic barrier that impedes station holding by a smooth surface and homogenous flow conditions over
												an extended distance, exceeding the swimming performance of the round goby while native species can
												ascend <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11681/5086">(Hoover et al., 2003)</a>. Nevertheless, to create species selective hydraulic conditions in a fish pass, it
												is important to understand how the fish species experience the flow differently and how the flow affects the
												individual swimming behaviour of the fish.</p>
											<p>To fill this knowledge gap, a three step-approach is implemented in the present thesis: This approach
												consisted of flow measurements (1. Step), force measurements on preserved fish (2. Step), and live fish
												swimming behaviour observations (3. Step). The direct forces experienced by preserved fish in the flow
												were measured as a proxy for the hydraulic burden live fish encounter when swimming against flow. The
												hydraulic burden fish experience was defined as the hydraulic force the fish body experiences from the flow
												field while passage. These hydraulic burden were then compared to live fish observations to describe how
												hydraulic burden mediate the live fish swimming behaviour. This was done to create evidence about how
												benthic fish respond behaviourally to flow and how this response differs between species.</p>
											<p>The aim of the present thesis was to create basic evidence about how the flow affects the fish species
												individually and whether the hydraulic burden experienced in the flow differ between species (Paper I, III,
												IV):</p>
											<p><b>Hypothesis 1: The hydraulic burden the fish experience while passage differ between species.</b></p>
											<p>Further, the present thesis aimed at evaluating a prototype, hydraulic, and selective barrier that was designed
												to impede the passage of the invasive round goby (Paper II, III):</p>
											<p><b>Hypothesis 2: The hydrodynamics in the barrier prevent the passage of the invasive round goby while
												native, comparable species can ascend.</b></p>
											<p>Finally, to assess how the hydraulic burden experienced by the fish affect passage behaviour, the hydraulic
												burden experienced by the fish were compared with the live fish swimming behaviour (Paper I, III, IV):</p>
											<p><b>Hypothesis 3: Species with smaller hydraulic burden have increased passage capability.</b></p>
											<p>Based on the above mentioned hypotheses, four publications were created with individual research
												questions (Fig. 1):</p>

											<p>Two experiments (Fig. 1) were performed to fill the knowledge gap. The first experiment focused on the
												hydraulic burden and the fish behaviour of the three test species (round goby, gudgeon and bullhead) under
												standardized and homogenous flow conditions in a flow channel in the laboratory at the University of Basel,
												Switzerland. In the second experiment, the prototype hydraulic barrier, as well as the hydraulic forces, and
												live fish swimming behaviour of the same species, were assessed in a realistic, full-scale fish pass model
												(test rig) at the Karlsruher Institute for Technology. To keep both experiments as comparable as possible,
												the three step-approach was applied in both experiments always with the same test species (round goby,
												gudgeon, and bullhead). To describe the dependency of the hydraulic forces experienced by the fish and
												the swimming behaviour from the flow velocity, both experiments were performed for different water
												discharges.</p>
											<p>After the live fish observations in both experiments, the fish were euthanized with an overdose of MS-222
												and preserved in formalin. Formalin increased the stiffness of the fish and preserved their body postures in
												a standardized way. After three days in 4% formalin with straight body postures, the fish were transferred
												stepwise via 40% ethanol (24 h) and 60% ethanol (24 h) to 75% ethanol solution to reduce toxicity of the
												fish (Paper I). The preserved fish were then punctuated vertically at the assumed centre of gravity with a
												needle and connected to the fixation stick. This fixation stick held the fish at position in the flow field and
												transduced the force experienced to the force sensor. All animal experiments were approved by the Swiss
												cantonal authorities (permits Nr. 2934 and 2846) and the German regional authorities (permit Nr. G217_17-
												IWG).</p>
											<h3>1. Flow channel study (Paper I and II)</h3>
											<p>We used a Loligo ® flow channel (swim Tunnel Respirometer, 185 L volume, 88 * 25 * 25 cm measuring
												chamber) to describe the flow, the forces and the swimming behaviour of our test species in a rectangular
												flume that had a shape being representative for our idea of a hydraulic barrier (homogenized flow over a
												smooth bottom for a distance of 88 cm) for a first quantification of flow conditions, the hydraulic forces
												and the swimming behaviour of live fish in a rectangular flume.</p>
											<h4>Flow channel study: Flow measurements</h4>
											<p>The flow velocity was measured using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV, Nortek Vectrino®) at 36
												positions in the measurement chamber and at three adjusted velocities (0.25, 0.55, and 0.85 m/s) that were
												considered relevant for swimming in benthic fish <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9867-2">(Tierney et al., 2011</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00280.x">Tudorache et al., 2008)</a>.</p>
											<h4>Flow channel study: Hydraulic forces</h4>
											<p>The hydraulic forces experienced by preserved fish were measured by a Vernier ® Go Direct Force and
												Acceleration Sensor (GDX-100609). The near ground-drag force was measured at 45 measurement points
												in the measurement chamber and at 0.25, 0.55, and 0.85 m/s flow velocity. This measurement was
												performed for single individuals of round goby, gudgeon, and bullhead with attached fins to display the
												spatial distribution of the forces above the bottom in the measurement chamber. In the next step, the
												hydraulic forces were measured at the central position in the flow channel at different velocity steps to
												measure the dependency of the hydraulic force from the flow velocity. To determine the effect of the fins
												on the forces experienced, three fish per species with attached and three fish with completely spread fins
												were tested in this measurement.</p>
											<h4>Flow channel study: Live fish swimming behaviour</h4>
											<p>First, prolonged swimming trials (Ucrit) were performed with 18 round goby, 12 gudgeon, and 12 bullhead.
												The single fish were released into the measurement chamber and left for 20 min in stagnant water for
												acclimatisation before the water flow was set to 0.15 m/s for 10 min. In the following, the flow speed was
												increased by 0.10 m/s every ten minutes until the fish could not hold position or showed signs of fatigue.</p>
											<p>Afterwards, sprint speeds (Usprint) of the three species were evaluated for 18 round goby, 11 gudgeon and
												12 bullhead. After 5 min acclimatisation at 0.05 m/s flow velocity, the flow was increased by 0.05 m/s
												every 10 s until the fish reached fatigue. Following a 10 min break in the measurement chamber with no
												flowing water, the experiment was repeated until the fish refused to swim or were unduly stressed. The fish
												were recorded during both assessments from vertical perspective by Gopro ® cameras (Hero 4).</p>
											<h3>2. Fish pass experiment at Karlsruher Institute for Technology (Paper II, III, and IV)</h3>
											<p>A nearly full scale test rig (1:1.6 scaled physical model of the fish pass in Koblenz, Germany) at the
												Theodor-Rehbock Hydraulic Laboratory at Karlsruher Institute for Technology (KIT), Germany (Fig. 1B)
												was used to assess the prototype hydraulic barrier and to describe the hydraulic burden experienced by
												preserved fish (round goby, gudgeon, and bullhead) and passage behaviour of live fish under realistic
												conditions. Water discharges can vary in real vertical slot fish passes, which is why three different water
												discharges (80, 105 and 130 L/s) were tested in the experiments. The two lower discharge rates were chosen
												to increase the probability of recording migration behaviour of the live fish, because they did not pose a
												challenge to the swimming capacities of the tested species as revealed from the flow channel study (Paper
												II). The 130 L/s water discharge was included in the experiment because we found this discharge led to the
												most representative flow velocities compared to actual best-practice vertical slot fish passes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.008">(Bombač et al.,
												2017)</a>. Flow measurement and live fish observations were performed at 80, 105, and 130 L/s water
												discharge. The force measurements were performed at 80 and 130 L/s and not at 105 L/s water discharge
												to increase the sample size of tested fish in the time available.</p>
											<h4>Fish pass experiment: Flow measurements</h4>
											<p>The acoustic Doppler (a similar device from the flow channel study) was mounted at an electronic,
												programmable, carriage (Isel ®) that was first adjusted over the prototype barrier (Fig 1). This carriage
												positioned the flow measurement probe at predefined measurement points automatically. Flow was
												measured at 14 measurement points, which were equally distributed over the barrier and ca. 2 cm above the
												bottom. Subsequently, the electronic carriage was adjusted above the untreated slot and the flow was
												measured at 19 measurement points which were equally distributed in the vicinity of the slot, ca. 2 cm
												above the bottom.</p>
											<h4>Fish pass experiment: Hydraulic forces</h4>
											<p>The hydraulic forces experienced by seven fish per species at 130 L/s water discharge and five fish per
												species at 80 L/s water discharge were measured using a water resistant (IP 68) force-torque sensor (Nano
												17, ATI ®), which was integrated in a PVC-hull to protect the sensor from disturbing flow. The force
												measurement probe was adjusted at the same electronic carriage and measurements were performed at the
												same measurement positions from the flow measurements. Four measurement points at the untreated slot
												were excluded from the force measurement because the probe design impeded positioning of the probe
												above these points.</p>
											<p>Similar to the flow channel study, the fish were punctuated and connected to the fixation stick prior the
												carriage positioned the fish over the first measurement point. At the measurement point, the hydraulic forces
												in X-, Y-, and Z-direction were recorded for 60 s with a data collection frequency of 1000 Hz. After the
												period of 60 s, the probe with the fish was positioned over the next measurement point and the data
												recording was started again.</p>
											<h4>Fish pass experiment: Live fish swimming behaviour</h4>
											<p>The fish were released downstream the untreated vertical slot and were able to swim freely in the test rig
												(Fig. 1B) unaffected by human presence for two hours to ensure the fish displayed only voluntary swimming
												behaviour. Because it was not clear how the fish might behave at the beginning of the experiments, the
												experimental period of two hours was chosen to increase the probability to observe a meaningful amount
												of untreated slot and barrier passages. Three cameras (Security-Center IR CCTV-Camera 380 TV-lines, IP
												68, Abus ®, Germany) were installed (one above the vertical slot, two above the prototype hydraulic
												barrier) and recorded the fish while passage. In addition, metal grids were used to block the vertical slot
												and barrier after the period of 2 h to enable counting the fish that had migrated finally after this period of
												2h.</p>
											<p>The experiment was performed for three water discharges (80, 105, and 130 L/s). Because 130 L/s was
												assumed most representative for the conditions in real fish passes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.008">(Bombač et al., 2017)</a>, the experiment
												was performed for three times at this water discharge. To increase the number of fish included in the
												experiments and thereby the probability to record migration behaviour with the cameras, all fish (43 ±4
												individuals per species) available were tested in every run. To discriminate between species in the video
												analysis, species were tested separately.</p>
											<p>Following the live fish experiment, the video footage was screened by eye and the time and number of
												defined events (Appendix 1) was recorded in the program Blender (v. 2.79). Afterwards, the paths of the
												fish that displayed these events were tracked in X-, Y- coordinates. These trajectories were used to compare
												the swimming patterns between the species at the different water discharges and to compare the swimming
												behaviour with the hydraulic burden experienced.</p>

											<h3>The prototype hydraulic barrier</h3>
											<p>The experiments revealed a species selective effect of the prototype hydraulic barrier. No invasive round
												goby passed the barrier at the highest water discharge tested (130 L/s), while six native gudgeon passed the
												barrier and four native bullhead attempted passage but immediately returned. That the selective effect was
												hydraulically mediated is probable because round goby has strongly changed its passage behaviour across
												the barrier between water discharges. Round goby was the species that passed the barrier most frequently
												of all tested species (18 times) at the lowest water discharge (80 L/s). In addition, round goby showed a
												general upstream dispersal tendency at the untreated slot downstream the barrier as indicated by 65 round
												gobies that passed at 130 L/s water discharge. One further observation supporting that the selective effect
												was hydraulically mediated was: gudgeon, the species with most passages across the barrier at 130 L/s
												water discharge, experienced the smallest hydraulic forces on the barrier and might therefore have
												experienced the lowest hydraulic burden while passage.</p>
											<p>Beside the selective effect, the prototype barrier had a general impact on the fish migration behaviour. There
												were significantly less passages recorded at the prototype hydraulic barrier compared to the downstream
												untreated slot across all water discharges. This might be explained by the need to overcome the untreated
												slot prior challenging the prototype barrier in our experiment. It is possible that the fish fatigued after
												passage of the untreated slot and were physiologically unable to pass the barrier accordingly. However, two
												hours experimental time may have enabled the fish to recover from the passage of the untreated slot. In
												addition, the same fish were used for the different experimental runs and the fish were therefore able to
												assess the flow fields and learn <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00042881">(Kieffer & Colgan, 1992)</a> the energetically favourable routes across barrier
												and slot. Indeed, that there was no clear change of the fish behaviour between the three runs performed at
												130 L/s water discharge (Paper IV), suggests that adaptation and learning across the experiments played
												rather a minor role. Another important point is that such flow field assessment effects of the fish can, beside
												in our experiments, also occur in real fish passes. At a barrier installed in a real fish pass, there would also
												be untreated slots that have to be overcome by the fish prior challenging the barrier. The experimental setup
												was as realistic as possible and the study was designed to exclusively record voluntary migration behaviour
												(the fish were completely unaffected by human presence for the experimental period of 2 h). Under these
												conditions the results showed: While having a species selective effect at 130 L/s water discharge, the barrier
												reduced the passage of all species at all water discharges compared to the untreated slot (Paper II).</p>
											<p><a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11681/5086">Hoover et al. (2003)</a> reported that a hydraulic barrier would have to maintain flow velocities greater than
												0.75 m/s over an extended distance to exceed the physiological swimming endurance of the round goby.
												<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9867-2">Tierney et al. (2011)</a> mentioned flow speeds > 1.25 m/s without microhabitats, allowing the fish to recover,
												to be required for withholding the round goby. Our flow measurements reveal that the prototype barrier
												fulfilled the requirements mentioned by <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11681/5086">Hoover et al. (2003)</a> but the flow speed was lower than the
												requirement suggested by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9867-2">(Tierney et al., 2011)</a>. The water flow velocity measured on the barrier at 130 L/s
												water discharge was 0.91 m/s ±0.08 SD (Standard deviation). Thereby, the water velocity above the barrier
												was higher and more homogenous than at the untreated slot (mean velocity of 0.74 m/s ±0.21 SD at 130
												L/s water discharge). This reveals: The barrier created a near-homogenous jet stream <a href="https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2006)132:8(765)">(Liu, Rajaratnam, &
												Zhu, 2006)</a> over the barrier length which affected the fish body differently, as indicated by force
												measurements. Thereby, we showed that the flow field created on the barrier primarily explains the differing
												live fish upstream migration behaviour, as revealed by the varied passage frequencies between untreated
												slot and barrier observed in the live fish observations (Paper II).</p>
											<p>Although the prototype hydraulic barrier performed promisingly in the reported laboratory experiments,
												the barrier must be assessed in long term field experiments to describe its long term-ecosystem impacts. It
												is possible that vegetation or debris on the barrier could alter the hydraulics of the barrier over time. In
												addition, two hours experimental time can be too short when compared to the time available to round gobies
												challenging the barrier in a real fish pass. It is possible that the fish exercise and learn how to overcome the
												barrier over time <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00042881">(Kieffer & Colgan, 1992)</a>. If then only the most powerful swimmers of the goby population
												can pass the barrier, it seems possible that these fish found an upstream population with species of increased
												migration tendency and swimming capability. How these potentially negative effects need to be weighed
												against the barrier’s positive effects has to be assessed in long term-field experiments.</p>
											<h3>The hydraulic burden experienced by the fish</h3>
											<p>Based on the referenced literature, the present thesis provides the first experimental comparison of the
												hydraulic forces experienced between real, preserved benthic fish species, at homogenised flow and in
												vertical slot fish pass flow fields. The hydraulic burden experienced by the fish in flowing water were
												shown to depend on the flow velocity and on the fish body surface exposed to the flow (Paper I). Thereby,
												the pectoral fin size and position were observed to have important impact on the hydraulic burden
												experienced by the fish. Especially round goby and bullhead experienced stronger forces when pectoral fins
												were spread (Paper I), which supports their specialized swimming style. Benthic fish have been described
												to adjust pectoral fin postures in a way that the forces experienced press the fish to the bottom and support
												station holding <a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.2749455">(Coombs et al., 2007)</a>. The experiments overall revealed significant differences in the
												hydraulic burden between fish species with the smallest hydraulic burden experienced by gudgeon, largest
												vertical force directed to the ground experienced by bullhead and median forces experienced by round goby.
												Considering that gudgeon is described as a powerful semi-pelagic swimmer <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00280.x">(Tudorache et al., 2008</a>, Paper
												II), that bullhead is highly oriented to the ground and uses flow sheltered regions between rocks to withstand
												the flow <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0363-z">(Gosselin et al., 2010</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00280.x">Tudorache et al., 2008</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-1112.2005.00782.x">Van Liefferinge et al., 2005</a>, Paper II), and that
												round goby has been described a versatile swimmer <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9867-2">(Tierney et al., 2011)</a>, the results suggest that the
												hydraulic burden corresponded to the individual swimming styles of the fish.</p>
											<p>These hydraulic burdens were recorded for different fish samples at two different positions with different
												flow fields in our experimental setup: At the barrier and the untreated slot. In both independent
												measurements, we recorded significantly smaller hydraulic burden for gudgeon at 130 L/s water discharge.
												This observation supports that the hydraulic burden variation between species remains stable between
												different flow fields of the untreated slot and the barrier.</p>
											<p>The hydraulic forces varied between measurement positions especially at the untreated slot, where we also
												observed local variation in the flow field. Positive correlation between hydraulic forces and flow velocity
												suggest that the local flow determines the force the fish experience (Paper III and IV) and thereby facilitated
												passage, especially at the untreated slot, where the flow field was more diverse. This result was not expected
												because we observed a strong dependency of the hydraulic forces from the adjusted water flow velocity
												when measuring at one central point in the measurement chamber (Paper I). In the untreated slot however,
												we observed this local change in the hydraulic burden across measurement points although the water
												discharge was fixed to 130 L/s (Paper IV). This finding suggest that local flow conditions (e.g. flow
												direction, flow velocity or turbulence) determine the local force experienced. This means that fish might be
												able to reduce their hydraulic burden during passage by choosing swimming routes of reduced hydraulic
												forces. Thereby, fish passes of diverse flow conditions might favour fish passage and homogenous flow
												conditions can have selective effects.</p>
											<h3>The effect of the hydraulic burden on the fish swimming behaviour</h3>
											<p>The fish varied in their upstream migration behaviour between species at the barrier as revealed by the
												random forest machine learning approach (Paper III). It was possible to identify round goby and gudgeon
												with high accuracy, only with information about water discharge and swimming patterns. When predicting
												the species, the most important predictor variable was the water discharge. This agrees with our observation
												that round goby showed most passages at lower water discharge, while gudgeon passed most frequently at
												higher water discharge at the untreated slot (Paper IV) and barrier (Paper III). Because the water discharge
												was the only varied parameter between the experiments, these findings support, together with the observed
												reduced hydraulic burden measured for gudgeon at higher water discharge, that hydraulic burden have an
												important effect on the individual swimming behaviour of the fish. Beside this species specific effect, there
												was a general adaptation observed in the swimming behaviour of all fish at higher water discharge. All fish
												increased their mean swimming speed, swam with more variable speed and used straighter paths on their
												way upstream the barrier; probably to reduce the hydraulic burden when swimming upstream.</p>
											<p>The hydraulic forces measured cannot reflect the general swimming behaviour of live fish in a flow field
												because this depends on the individual species biology <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-1112.2004.00568.x">(Blake, 2004</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.2749455">Coombs et al., 2007</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/48.757275">Sfakiotakis et
												al., 1999)</a> and individual personality traits <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2629">(Hirsch et al., 2017</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7964">Lothian & Lucas, 2021)</a>. However, hydraulic
												forces can provide evidence of one piece of a puzzle of all determinants of fish swimming behaviour: The
												physical burden the fish experience in the flow due to their body exposed to the flow. It is known that flow
												conditions can support swimming or make swimming more difficult. For example, turbulence is reported
												to have important impact on the swimming performance in fish <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10525-005-0125-z">(Lupandin, 2005)</a> and can have positive, as
												well as negative impact on fish swimming performance. Fish can make use of areas of reduced vorticity to
												save energy <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00027524">(Facey & Grossman, 1992)</a> and also experience passive propulsion under specific flow
												conditions <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112005007925">(Beal et al., 2006)</a>. Although smaller forces at measurements with fish compared to a reference
												run without fish were detected at 130 L/s at the untreated slot (Paper IV) and in the flow channel experiment
												(Paper I), no forces directed against flow direction were revealed by the measurements with the 3D-sensor
												when a fish was connected to the fixation stick. We do therefore not assume that the fish experienced
												passive propulsion in our experiments.</p>
											<p>Measuring hydraulic forces experienced by the fish can be a refinement of the common approach, which is
												to assess fish passes by flow characterisation and live fish observations (e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.202.18.2393">Drucker & Lauder, 1999</a>;
												<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.3132">Porreca et al., 2017</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/alr/2009008">Sagnes & Statzner, 2009)</a>. The force measurements provide a new, direct and
												standardized way to describe how the created flow field, which is determined by the fish pass design, affects
												the fish physically. This approach does not require the use of live fish and thereby improves fish welfare
												by avoiding animal experiments. However, there is more research needed to understand how the species
												respond to the hydraulic burden individually.</p>
											<h3>Challenges</h3>
											<p>The direct forces applied to surrounding water of swimming fish are not directly measurable, which
												complicates the quantification of their locomotor forces <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.202.18.2393">(Drucker & Lauder, 1999)</a>. The applied approach
												to measure the forces by real, preserved fish was an approximation to live fish swimming several
												millimetres above ground but it did not account for the impact of movement and different body postures on
												the forces experienced.</p>
											<p>The live fish observations of the first experiment revealed that especially round goby and bullhead used
												flow channel corners and friction forces to withstand the flow (Paper I and II). Because friction was not
												standardisable with the measuring device applied, it was not possible to account for the usage of friction
												forces to withstand the flow in benthic fish <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.051938">(Carlson & Lauder, 2011)</a> in the present study. This important
												question, how benthic fish resist the flow by using friction forces, remains a future challenge.</p>
											<p>Prior to testing preserved fish, there was the idea to 3D-scan real fish, print them by a 3D-printer, and
												measure the forces experienced by 3D-printed fish as a proxy for real fish. Using computer manipulation,
												it would have been possible to create multiple 3D-models of the same fish with different fin and body
												postures. This would have enabled to test the effect of fin and body posture on the forces experienced in a
												more standardized way than it was possible with the preserved fish. Another advantage would have been
												that the measurements would have been highly replicable because the model could be used several times,
												the model shape data could be stored and published in a repository and replicates of the model could be
												printed with a 3D-printerby researchers everywhere in the world. Indeed, it turned out at the beginning of
												this research project, that the 3D-scan and 3D-print represent two methodological steps adding important
												inaccuracy to the model due to technical limitations. Because the shape of the 3D-printed models varied
												obviously from real fish shapes, preserved fish turned out to be best representative for real fish for the
												experiments. Nevertheless, further development of the 3D-printing technique might enable its application
												in such studies in future.</p>
											<h3>Conclusion</h3>
											<p>The present work provides a description of the performance of a prototype hydraulic barrier which was
												designed to impede the upstream migration of the invasive round goby, while enabling passage of native,
												comparable species. With application of the three step-approach, it was possible to describe the barrier’s
												mechanism, which was based on the creation of flow conditions affecting the swimming behaviour of the
												fish species differently.</p>
											<p>From an applied research perspective, it became evident that the prototype hydraulic barrier had a selective
												effect at 130 L/s water discharge because no round goby passed the barrier, while gudgeon and bullhead
												passed. Because the hydraulic forces differed between species and corresponded to the live fish swimming
												behaviour, and the live fish passage behaviour differed between water discharges, it is highly probable that
												the selective effect of the barrier was mediated by the created flow field. As this evidence merged from a
												laboratory experiment, long term field studies are necessary to assess the performance of the barrier in the
												field and its impact on the ecosystem.</p>
											<p>From a basic research perspective, this thesis developed an approach to compare the hydraulic burden
												comparable benthic fish encounter when swimming in flowing water. In addition, this thesis provides the
												first empiric assessment of the hydraulic forces that benthic fish experience in flow fields of such ecological
												importance. An important insight was that the fish indeed experience hydraulic burden differing between
												species and that these hydraulic burdens correspond to the individual swimming styles of the corresponding
												species. The fish respond to these hydraulic burden individually, depending on their own species biology.
												Nevertheless, there was a general adaptation of the passage behaviour to increased water discharge: All
												species swam faster with more speed variation and with straighter paths upstream the barrier.</p>
											<p>This thesis is a further step towards species selective fragmentation of rivers for ecosystem conservation
												purposes. These findings open an avenue to fish pass design adapted to the fish community of specific
												ecosystems and will inform fish pass engineers, decision makers and researchers who work about the
												behavioural response of fish to flowing water.</p>
											<h3>Outlook and perspectives</h3>
											<h4>Assessment of the barrier for more species</h4>
											<p>The barrier performed promisingly in the experiments and the need to perform field studies to describe the
												long term effect of the barrier and its ecosystem effects was already mentioned. Indeed, the effect of the
												barrier on further species is still unknown. Therefore, special attention should be spent on the effect of the
												barrier on the passage performance of all further species that were not included in the present study to
												ensure their passage will not be negatively affected by the barrier.</p>
											<h4>Assessment of fish passes for their suitability of target species</h4>
											<p>The force measurement enabled a close description of the hydraulic burden the fish have to overcome when
												swimming upstream a vertical slot fish pass. Thereby, the force measurements provided a more direct flow
												field assessment for the requirements of the specific species than common flow measurements, such as
												acoustic Doppler-velocimeter applications. Measuring hydraulic forces provides a valuable technique
												enabling the assessment of fish pass designs for the suitability for species of relevance for the corresponding
												ecosystem. This method can be applied in the laboratory at prototype fish pass models or in the field at
												constructions that exist already. Nevertheless, because it is still not possible to measure the forces fish
												experience while swimming, future research should focus on the refinement of this measurement technique.</p>
											<h4>Development of the force measuring technique</h4>
											<p>There is potential to further develop and improve the force measurement technique. In the reported
												approach, the preserved fish were connected to the multi-axis force-torque sensor via a fixation stick. The
												stick was five times smaller compared to flow channel study (Paper I), which increased the precision of the
												measurement, but the stick was still exposed to the flow and thereby affected the forces measured. In
												addition, because the stick represented a lever, it was not possible to account for all measurement channels
												provided by the sensor because it was not possible to account for the torque experienced by the fish. If
												integrating the sensor in the fish, these problems would have been avoided and all sensor channels could
												have been used including force in X-, Y-, Z-direction and torque in X-, Y-, and Z-direction. Indeed, the size
												of both, fish and sensor impeded an integration of the sensor. With continued development of such sensors
												to smaller size or testing larger fish, these problems could be solved.</p>
											<h4>Automated fish pass monitoring</h4>
											<p>With tracking the live fish and predicting the species based on swimming trajectory features that trained a
												random forest machine learning approach, this thesis provides the basics for automated fish identification
												based on swimming patterns. Similar approaches based on automated fish contour recognition <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489482">(Mandal et
												al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsw106">Shafait et al., 2016)</a> are already available, but these approaches require high resolution images of
												the fish contours. When identifying the fish via individual swimming patterns, also poor image quality
												without sharp contours could be sufficient for species identification because only tracking the trajectories
												of the fish is required. To further develop this approach, it is promising to replace the supervised random
												forest machine learning algorithm by an unsupervised approach, such as Convolutional Neural Networks
												<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2015.320">(Wang & Gupta, 2015)</a>, that account for patterns in the swimming paths that were not accounted by the
												trajectory features included in the present study. This model could be implemented in a tracking program
												that automatically records fish trajectories (e. g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2014.034">Rodríguez et al., 2015</a>) and feeds the trajectories to the fish
												identification model. All technical tools for such an approach are available. The largest challenge might be
												to obtain sufficient training data of fish migrating upstream with known identity.</p>
